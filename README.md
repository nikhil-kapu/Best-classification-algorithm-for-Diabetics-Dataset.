# Best-classification-algorithm-for-Diabetics-Dataset.
Final Lab project for the coursework Data Warehousing and Data Mining. I have applied 4 classification algorithms - Gaussian NB, Decision tree Classifier, KNN, Logistic RegressionApplied them on the diabetic’s dataset and compared the results on 4 parameters. Decision tree classifier performed the best due to the following parameters: Accuracy – How many were correctly labelled.: 0.7922077922077922 Precision – How many of those we labelled as diabetic are actually diabetic.: 0.666667 Recall – Out of all the diabetic, how many were correctly predicted.: 0.608696 F1 – Harmonic average of precision and Recall.: 0.636364
